            <p>When I met Lisa, the Lord told me I’d marry this girl and He’d give me a ministry in a Barn. We had no
              idea He meant the barn in the back yard! And yet, ministry naturally took place there starting with
              meetings in the hay loft that lasted into the wee hours of the morning. The fog would be rolling in and
              dew falling, but no one wanted to leave God’s presense. Then we heard the Lord say to prepare the barn
              for year round ministry. The rest, as they say, is history!</p>

            <p>Paul and Georgeanne are founding members of the church having ministered with the pastors since House of
              Faith’s inception. Proving themselves as co-laborers in Christ with the Duncans has reaped untold
              blessings to the body of Christ. However large or small the issue, one can be assured that the Nagys are
              behind it all making sure it all comes together.</p>

            <h5>Pastor Isack Wanjohi</h5>
            <p><strong>Minister of Evangelism</strong></p>
            <p>Pastor Isack grew up in Kenya and one day, as he tended the cows, the Lord supernaturally taught him to
              read English. Then He called Isack to go to America to evangelize. With little money, knowing no one, he
              left family and friends and crossed the ocean. He traveled several years looking for where God was
              calling him. When Isack arrived at the barn and saw the sign “House of Faith – Full Gospel Church” he
              knew he was home. Since then his radio and prison ministry has saved many.</p>
