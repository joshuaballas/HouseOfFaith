          <h3>Free Indeed</h3>
          <p>After years of answering the call to minister outside the church walls, Pastor Skip founded Free Indeed in
            2013 and brought it under the covering of House of Faith in 2014. The goal - to tell the least of these
            about Jesus, and to let the lost and the captives know what it says in John 8:36 – He who the Son sets
            free, is free indeed. In addition to evangelism, we distribute food, clothing and bedding to local shelters
            and missions and directly to the community through outreach.</p>

          <h3>Hands and Feet Project</h3>
          <p>The ministry of the Hands and Feet Project started as a “pay it forward” vision where struggling and
            barely making it parents could find clothing, shoes, baby items, and more to help make ends meet. It has
            grown into a volunteer operated organization assisting 100s of families a year. You can help by donating
            and by coming in a few days a month to fold and sort the donations.</p>

          <h3>Waypoint Youth & Community Center</h3>
          <p>Waypoint Youth and Community Center was birthed through a desire to fight the pervading drug abuse in the
            community by reaching the kids. The idea was to create a WAYPOINT and safe haven, helping youth find their
            purpose and passions while achieving their potential through empowering, nurturing, and mentoring them.</p>
